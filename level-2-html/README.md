# Level 2 – HTML Foundations

## What HTML Does
HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.
It tells the browser what content to show and how it is organized.

## Tags vs Elements
A tag is the name inside angle brackets like <p>.
An element includes the opening tag, content, and closing tag.

Example:
<p>This is a paragraph</p>

## Head vs Body
Head contains metadata like title and charset.
Body contains the content visible to users.

## Difference Between div and Semantic Tags
div has no meaning.
Semantic tags like header, section, and footer describe the purpose of content.

## What Confused Me the Most
Understanding when to use section and div was confusing at first,
but I learned that section is better when content has meaning.
